**This community run development fund is the only source of non-VC, non-dilutive, grants funding in the HNS community. Our goal is to support and empower our fellow open source developers and creators in their mission to create a free and open internet.**

## Development Fund Structure
* 80% of funds go to independent creators and core devs working on the HNS stack on a monthly basis. I will maintain a spreadsheet of recipients, the grant transactions, and announce recipients every month in The Shake.
* 20% of funds will be held in reserve to fund bounties that tackle big/long term projects on the core protocol. If we cannot give away the full 80% of monthly grants, those funds will be rolled over into this reserve. Reserves are held in a separate wallet(TK insert wallet address) for easier accounting and management.
