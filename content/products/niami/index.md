Welcome to niami! Rating handshake domains since 2020
Niami brings transparency into the namebase domain marketplace. With niami you can:
1. Find interesting domains more easily.
2. Find cheap domains.
3. Check if your domain has already been rated.

How does it work?
Niami's algorithm tries to determine the rarity of a domain. __Warning: This algorithm is still in a very early phase!__ There are no people involved. I don't want to reveal exactly how it works (because you could potentially manipulate it). But to give you an idea, here are some factors that influence the domain rating:

- name length
- number of digits in a domain
- number of hyphens or underscores
- number of hyphens or underscores
- how often is the word used in the world*
- is there a wikipedia entry for that name
...and much more

*Sorry, at the moment niami only supports the english language. But I defnitely want to support more languages in the future.
